### Intro to GitHub Classroom and Replit

We are using a tool called GitHub classroom to generate a repository (repo) on GitHub for each student to work in.

Each day we will share an assignment invitation here on this page. Clicking on the link will take you to a page where you will see as message that looks something like this:

![](../assets/img/gh-classroom-screenshot.jpg)

You'll see your github username as part of the repo name. When you accept the assignment, GitHub will create your homework repo and, when it is done, give you a link to it (from now on, this is the link you will use to see your project on GitHub, NOT the assignment invitation link). The url for this link will be the one you search for in Replit.

Go to Replit, and click New Repl. Choose the language that matches the assignment. For now, that's HTML, CSS, JS. Later it will be Python. The Repl will be created with a random name. Rename it to the same name as the homework assignment. Once it has been created, click the "Version Control" icon on the far left that looks like a wishbone. Choose "Existing Git Repository" and select your personal repo for this assignment.


### Using Replit

When you have made a series of changes to your Repl, click the Version Control icon again, write a note in the box about what changes and additions you have made, and then click "Commit and Push." That will send this code to GitHub. Make sure you do this for all code that you write that you want to be included in your homework assignment.
