### Project

Install [Git-It](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron), a tutorial program that will walk you through the basics of Git and GitHub.

To install it, run:
`brew cask install git-it`

This should put the Git-it program in your `/Applications` folder.

Git-it will tell you to install Github Desktop. You do not have to install this, although you can if you want. We won't be using it in class.

When you try and run Git-it, you may get a notice that the application is from an unknown developer. If so, right-click on the application and then choose "Open." You will be presented with a dialog -- choose to run the application.

Once running, complete the tasks in Git-it. Completion of the assignment is the link to your pull request you will make in the second-to-last Git-It task.

[Submit that url using this form](https://forms.gle/hKL37abHZ7TEoyWT6).
